    <h1>Baked Goat Cheese Dip</h1>
    <img src="../media/images/goatCheese.webp" alt="image of a baked goat cheese dip">
    <p>Goat cheese is baked with marinara sauce and topped with fresh basil to make this super easy <br>
        appetizer in a flash! Serve fresh out of the oven with crostini or garlic bread for dipping.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>1 (8 ounce) goat cheese log</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>2 cups marinara sauce</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>¼ teaspoon kosher or sea salt (optional)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>¼ cup fresh basil, cut into ribbons</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Press goat cheese to fit the shape of a small baking dish, leaving a 1-inch border <br>
                around the edge. Gently spoon marinara sauce around the border, taking care to cover the <br>
                edge of goat cheese but not the middle. Sprinkle with salt.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Bake in the preheated oven until goat cheese is hot and soft and marinara sauce is <br>
                hot and bubbling, 20 to 25 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Remove from the oven and sprinkle with freshly chopped basil.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
