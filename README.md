# odin-recipes
Here is a simple project depicting a website linking to multiple recipie pages that includes an image of the recipe
, a short description, ingredients and the steps to follow.

this project made me practice basic git commands, basic terminal commands and basic html.

A.For git: Adding changes to be commited (git add)
           
           Commiting changes locally (git commit)
           
           Pushing changes on git hub (git push)
           
           I also learned how to have your html code be viewed as a webpage 
           directly from your git reposatory via Pages


B.For Html: Writing boilerplate code for every page(<!DOCTYPE html> <html lang="en"> etc)

            Creating subdirectories for pages and media

            linking pages to one another via (<a href>)

C.For teminal: Navigating the file system and manipulating files and dicertories via (ls, cd, rm, mkdir(mkdir -p for directory with sub), touch, etc)
